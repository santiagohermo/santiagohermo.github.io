  title = {Collective Bargaining, Rent-Sharing, and the Propagation of Shocks},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago},
  year = {2023},
  journal = {Job Market Paper - Draft coming soon},
  abstract = {Many countries organize their labor market into collective bargaining units, in which unions and employer associations negotiate provisions for workers, such as wage floors.
    I study the implications of this institutional structure for the allocation of labor market rents and its adjustment to economic shocks.
    To do so, I leverage novel administrative data which allows constructing the network linking firms to collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) in Argentina.
    My research design exploits exogenous changes in world import demand in 2009--2013 to construct product-market shocks at the firm and CBA levels, and compares similar firms that are subject to different shocks.
    I find that wages increase more strongly as a response to a CBA shock than to a firm shock, and that this effect is driven by changes in wage floors, highlighting the role of collective bargaining in rent-sharing.
    However, whereas a positive firm shock also increases employment, a positive 
    CBA shock does not.
    These results imply that CBAs spread the effect of economic shocks to firms and workers not directly affected by them. I develop a general equilibrium model of the labor market with collective bargaining to study what features of CBAs affect the propagation of shocks. The estimated model reveals that shocks propagate more strongly when unions have more bargaining power and when CBAs are more homogeneous in terms of firm productivity.},

  abstract = {A large literature in cognitive science studies the puzzling “Flynn effect” of rising fluid intelligence (reasoning skill) in rich countries. We develop an economic model in which a cohort’s mix of skills is determined by different skills’ relative returns in the labor market and by the technology for producing skills. We estimate the model using administrative data from Sweden. Combining data from exams taken at military enlistment with earnings records from the tax register, we document an increase in the relative labor market return to logical reasoning skill as compared to vocabulary knowledge. The estimated model implies that changes in labor market returns explain 37\\% of the measured increase in reasoning skill, and can also explain the decline in knowledge. An original survey of parents, an analysis of trends in school curricula, and an analysis of occupational characteristics show evidence of increasing emphasis on reasoning as compared to knowledge.},

  abstract = {The recent rise of sub-national minimum wage (MW) policies in the US has resulted in significant dispersion of MW levels within metropolitan areas. In this paper, we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies. For each location we define both the log MW where the average resident works (the "workplace MW") and the log MW in the location itself (the "residence MW"). We derive a partial-equilibrium model of a housing market in which MW levels in each location affect housing demand by changing the income of commuters and the prices of non-tradable consumption. The model shows that the workplace MW has a positive effect on rents whereas the residence MW has a negative effect. We construct a ZIP code by month panel using rents data from Zillow, and use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of residence and workplace MW changes on median housing rents. Our baseline results imply that a 10 percent increase in the workplace MW and no change in the residence MW will increase rents by 0.69 percent (SE=0.29). If the residence MW also increases by 10 percent, then rents will increase by 0.47 percent (SE=0.16). We use our results to study the incidence of two counterfactual MW policies: a federal MW increase and a city MW increase. We estimate that landlords pocket 9.2 and 11.0 cents for every dollar increase in worker income in areas affected by these policies. However, the incidence varies systematically across space.},

@article{Hermo2017,
  title = {The Structure of Wages in Argentina 1992-2016: The Role of Demand and Supply},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago},
  year = {2017},
  journal = {LII Annual Meeting of the Argentine Association of Political Economy},
  month = {11},
  abstract = {The skill wage premium, both for individuals with complete tertiary and complete secondary education, increased in Argentina between 1992 and 2003 and decreased afterwards. These movements are correlated with income inequality and are probably an important part of the reason of the rise and fall in inequality during the twenty-five-year period under analysis. Thinking about inequality as a market-determined phenomenon, this paper presents an explanation of the movements in relative wages based on a supply and demand framework. It is found that the relative supply of women increased substantially and, nevertheless, their relative wage increased. In fact, the gender wage gap decreased, although gains were concentrated among skilled women. For skilled workers, it is found that their relative supply grew ceaselessly throughout the period. Since the relative wage increased in 1992-2003, and decreased afterwards, it is established that an increase in relative demand for skilled labor must have occurred in the former period. After 2003, however, relative demand stagnated (or even declined) and relative wages started to fall with the increase in supply. Some possible variables that might explain this behavior are proposed and discussed.},
