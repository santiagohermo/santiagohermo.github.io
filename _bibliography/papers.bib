  abstract = {
    I study the role of collective bargaining, a prevalent wage-setting 
    institution in many countries, in determining the effects of economic
    shocks on workers and firms.
    To do so, I leverage novel administrative data which allows me to construct 
    the network linking employers to collective bargaining agreements
    in Argentina.
    I exploit changes in world import demand between 2009 and 2013 to construct 
    exogenous shocks to product demand and to study how these shocks propagate 
    through the collective bargaining network.
    My findings indicate that 
    a shock equivalent to a 10\% rise in firm revenue leads to a 1.5\% increase 
    in wages, and 
    a shock equivalent to a 10\% rise in average revenue of firms under the 
    same agreement leads to a 4.3\% increase in wages.
    The evidence suggests that these effects are driven by changes in common 
    wage floors, which means that bargaining extends the impact of economic 
    shocks to firms and workers not directly affected.
    I develop a general equilibrium model of the labor market with 
    collective bargaining and firm heterogeneity to quantify how the degree 
    of centralization of bargaining affects the propagation of shocks.
    The estimated model indicates that the degree of shock propagation is 
    hump-shaped in the degree of centralization, with highly decentralized or 
    highly centralized bargaining structures leading to less propagation 
    than intermediate levels of centralization.},

  abstract = {A large literature in cognitive science studies the puzzling “Flynn effect” of rising fluid intelligence (reasoning skill) in rich countries.
    We develop an economic model in which a cohort's mix of skills is determined by different skills' relative returns in the labor market and by the technology for producing skills.
    We estimate the model using administrative data from Sweden.
    Combining data from exams taken at military enlistment with earnings records from the tax register, we document an increase in the relative labor market return to logical reasoning skill as compared to vocabulary knowledge.
    The estimated model implies that changes in labor market returns explain 37\\% of the measured increase in reasoning skill, and can also explain the decline in knowledge.
    An original survey of parents, an analysis of trends in school curricula, and an analysis of occupational characteristics show evidence of increasing emphasis on reasoning as compared to knowledge.},

  abstract = {The recent rise of sub-national minimum wage (MW) policies in the US has resulted in significant dispersion of MW levels within urban areas. In this paper, we study the spillover effects of these policies on local rental markets through commuting. To do so, for each USPS ZIP code we construct a “workplace” MW measure based on the location of its resident’s jobs, and use it to estimate the effect of MW policies on rents. We use a novel identification strategy that exploits the fine timing of differential changes in the workplace MW across ZIP codes that share the same “residence” MW, defined as the same location’s MW. Our baseline results imply that a 10 percent increase in the workplace MW increases rents at residence ZIP codes by 0.69 percent. To illustrate the importance of commuting patterns, we use our estimates and a simple model to simulate the impact of federal and city counterfactual MW policies. The simulations suggest that landlords pocket approximately 10 cents of each dollar generated by the MW across directly and indirectly affected areas, though the incidence on landlords varies systematically across space.},

@techreport{HermoSidicaroTrombetta,
  title = {Firms and the Evolution of Earnings Inequality in Argentina's Volatile Economy},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago and Trombetta, Martín and Sidicaro, Nicolás},
  year = {},
  month = {},
  descr = {We document large fluctuations in earning inequality between 1995 and 2019 in Argentina. 
  Leveraging Argentina's matched employer-employee dataset, we fit high-dimensional models 
  of log earnings as a function of worker and firm fixed effects. 
  Using our estimates we decompose the variance of log earnings into three components: 
  worker characteristics, firm characteristics and assortative matching. 
  We find a large contribution of firms to inequality: they account for one-third of 
  the decline in inequality between the 1990s and 2000s, and fully explain the increase in the 2010s. 
  On the other hand, we find a muted role for matching between high-wage workers and high-wage firms. 
  We study the role of several drivers of firm-pay in driving these results, including firm productivity 
  and collective bargaining institutions.},

@article{Hermo2017,
  title = {The Structure of Wages in Argentina 1992-2016: The Role of Demand and Supply},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago},
  year = {2017},
  journal = {LII Annual Meeting of the Argentine Association of Political Economy},
  month = {11},
  abstract = {The skill wage premium, both for individuals with complete tertiary and complete secondary education, increased in Argentina between 1992 and 2003 and decreased afterwards.
    These movements are correlated with income inequality and are probably an important part of the reason of the rise and fall in inequality during the twenty-five-year period under analysis.
    Thinking about inequality as a market-determined phenomenon, this paper presents an explanation of the movements in relative wages based on a supply and demand framework.
    It is found that the relative supply of women increased substantially and, nevertheless, their relative wage increased. In fact, the gender wage gap decreased, although gains were concentrated among skilled women.
    For skilled workers, it is found that their relative supply grew ceaselessly throughout the period.
    Since the relative wage increased in 1992-2003, and decreased afterwards, it is established that an increase in relative demand for skilled labor must have occurred in the former period.
    After 2003, however, relative demand stagnated (or even declined) and relative wages started to fall with the increase in supply.
    Some possible variables that might explain this behavior are proposed and discussed.},
