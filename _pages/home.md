Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/).

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
Specifically, I study how institutional constraints affect outcomes in labor and 
housing markets.
I am also interested in studying the drivers of skill investment.

You can see my CV [here](cv).
