Welcome! 
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University.

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
I apply advanced empirical methods to study how local labor market institutions spill over across local labor and housing markets.
I am also interested in understanding the drivers of skill investment.

You can see my CV [here](https://santiagohermo.github.io/curriculum/).
