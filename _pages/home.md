Welcome! 
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University.
My research interests lie in Labor and Urban Economics.
I apply advanced empirical methods to study how labor market institutions spill over across local labor markets and housing markets.
I am also interested in understanding the drivers of skill investment.

You can see my CV [here](https://santiagohermo.github.io/curriculum/).
