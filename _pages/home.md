Welcome! 
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/).

**I am on the job market for the academic year 2023-2024.** <br>
You can find my CV [here](cv).

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
Specifically, I study how spatial linkages affect outcomes in labor and 
housing markets.
I am also interested in studying the drivers of skill investment.

In my Job Market Paper I study the consequences of links between firms created 
by collective bargaining institutions for the propagation of economic shocks 
in the labor market.
