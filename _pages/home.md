Welcome! 
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University.

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
I apply advanced empirical methods to study the consequences of the existence of networks across local markets, such as those created by sectoral bargaining agreements or commuting, for the diffusion of economic shocks across the economy.
I also work on studying the drivers of skill investment.

You can see my CV [here](https://santiagohermo.github.io/curriculum/).
