Welcome! 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [University of Oslo](https://www.sv.uio.no/econ/english/)
for the academic year 2024/25.
In September 2025 I will join [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/business/economics) as 
an assistant professor (lecturer).

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
I study how institutions, such as collective bargaining and minimum wage policies, 
affect outcomes in labor and housing markets.
I am also interested in studying the drivers of skill investment.

I received my PhD in Economics from [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/) in 2024.
You can find my CV 
<a href="assets/pdf/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at
[santiago.hermo@monash.edu](mailto:santiago.hermo@monash.edu).
