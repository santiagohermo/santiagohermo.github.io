Welcome! 
I am a lecturer (assistant professor) at 
[Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/business/economics), based in Melbourne, Australia.

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
I study how institutions, such as collective bargaining and minimum wage policies, 
affect outcomes in labor and housing markets.
I am also interested in studying the drivers of skill investment.

I received my PhD in Economics from [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/) in 2024.
In the 2024-2025 academic year I worked as a researcher at [University of Oslo](https://www.sv.uio.no/econ/english/).
You can find my CV 
<a href="assets/pdf/cv_santiago_hermo.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at
