Welcome! 
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/).

**I am on the job market for the academic year 2023-2024.** <br>
You can find my CV 
<a href="assets/pdf/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

My research interests are in Labor and Urban Economics.
I focus on how spatial linkages affect outcomes in labor and housing markets.
I am also interested in studying the drivers of skill investment.

In my 
<a href="assets/pdf/Hermo_JMP_CollectiveBargaining.pdf" target="_blank">Job Market Paper</a>
I study the role played by collective bargaining institutions 
in shaping the response of wages and employment to 
economic shocks.
Using data from Argentina, 
I find that wages in a firm respond to shocks to other firms 
in the same bargaining unit, and that this response is 
driven by updates in common wage floors.
I develop a spatial economic model with collective 
bargaining to study how the structure of collective 
bargaining units affects the propagation of shocks 
across firms.
