  title = {Collective Bargaining, Rent-Sharing, and the Propagation of Shocks},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago},
  year = {2023},
  journal = {Job Market Paper - Draft coming soon},
  abstract = {Many countries organize their labor market into collective bargaining units, in which unions and employer associations negotiate provisions for workers, such as wage floors.
    I study the implications of this institutional structure for the allocation of labor market rents and its adjustment to economic shocks.
    To do so, I leverage novel administrative data which allows constructing the network linking firms to collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) in Argentina.
    My research design exploits exogenous changes in world import demand in 2009-2013 to construct product-market shocks at the firm and CBA levels, and compares similar firms that are subject to different shocks.
    I find that wages increase more strongly as a response to a CBA shock than to a firm shock, and that this effect is driven by changes in wage floors, highlighting the role of collective bargaining in rent-sharing.
    However, whereas a positive firm shock also increases employment, a positive 
    CBA shock does not.
    These results imply that CBAs spread the effect of economic shocks to firms and workers not directly affected by them. I develop a general equilibrium model of the labor market with collective bargaining to study what features of CBAs affect the propagation of shocks. The estimated model reveals that shocks propagate more strongly when unions have more bargaining power and when CBAs are more homogeneous in terms of firm productivity.},

  abstract = {A large literature in cognitive science studies the puzzling “Flynn effect” of rising fluid intelligence (reasoning skill) in rich countries. We develop an economic model in which a cohort’s mix of skills is determined by different skills’ relative returns in the labor market and by the technology for producing skills. We estimate the model using administrative data from Sweden. Combining data from exams taken at military enlistment with earnings records from the tax register, we document an increase in the relative labor market return to logical reasoning skill as compared to vocabulary knowledge. The estimated model implies that changes in labor market returns explain 37\\% of the measured increase in reasoning skill, and can also explain the decline in knowledge. An original survey of parents, an analysis of trends in school curricula, and an analysis of occupational characteristics show evidence of increasing emphasis on reasoning as compared to knowledge.},

  abstract = {The recent rise of sub-national minimum wage (MW) policies in the US has resulted in significant dispersion of MW levels within urban areas. In this paper, we study the spillover effects of these policies on local rental markets through commuting. To do so, for each USPS ZIP code we construct a “workplace” MW measure based on the location of its resident’s jobs, and use it to estimate the effect of MW policies on rents. We use a novel identification strategy that exploits the fine timing of differential changes in the workplace MW across ZIP codes that share the same “residence” MW, defined as the same location’s MW. Our baseline results imply that a 10 percent increase in the workplace MW increases rents at residence ZIP codes by 0.69 percent. To illustrate the importance of commuting patterns, we use our estimates and a simple model to simulate the impact of federal and city counterfactual MW policies. The simulations suggest that landlords pocket approximately 10 cents of each dollar generated by the MW across directly and indirectly affected areas, though the incidence on landlords varies systematically across space.},

@techreport{HermoSidicaroTrombetta,
  title = {Firms and the Evolution of Earnings Inequality in Argentina's Volatile Economy},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago and Trombetta, Martín and Sidicaro, Nicolás},
  year = {},
  month = {},
  descr = {This paper analyzes the contribution of firms, workers and sorting to the evolution of wage inequality in Argentina between 1995 and 2019. To do so, we leverage Argentina's matched employer-employee dataset and regress log earnings on worker and firm fixed effects. Then, we decompose the variance of log earnings into three components: worker characteristics, firm characteristics and assortative matching. We find that the contribution of firms to inequality is large: above 1/3 of the total variance of log earnings is due to firms across the entire period. When looking at the drivers of changes in inequality, we find that the large reduction in inequality following the 2001-2002 crisis was driven by a decrease in the variance of both worker and firm effects, with no changes in assortative matching. We also note a mild increase in inequality in the 2010s that is explained by an increase in the variance of firm effects. We study several mechanisms that could explain the large role of firms in determining Argentina's income inequality.},

@article{Hermo2017,
  title = {The Structure of Wages in Argentina 1992-2016: The Role of Demand and Supply},
  author = {Hermo, Santiago},
  year = {2017},
  journal = {LII Annual Meeting of the Argentine Association of Political Economy},
  month = {11},
  abstract = {The skill wage premium, both for individuals with complete tertiary and complete secondary education, increased in Argentina between 1992 and 2003 and decreased afterwards. These movements are correlated with income inequality and are probably an important part of the reason of the rise and fall in inequality during the twenty-five-year period under analysis. Thinking about inequality as a market-determined phenomenon, this paper presents an explanation of the movements in relative wages based on a supply and demand framework. It is found that the relative supply of women increased substantially and, nevertheless, their relative wage increased. In fact, the gender wage gap decreased, although gains were concentrated among skilled women. For skilled workers, it is found that their relative supply grew ceaselessly throughout the period. Since the relative wage increased in 1992-2003, and decreased afterwards, it is established that an increase in relative demand for skilled labor must have occurred in the former period. After 2003, however, relative demand stagnated (or even declined) and relative wages started to fall with the increase in supply. Some possible variables that might explain this behavior are proposed and discussed.},
